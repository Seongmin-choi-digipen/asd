# CS099 Create an EmotionalFace Class

Create your own EmotionalFace class using javascript ES6.

The EmotionalFace should have a `constructor()`, an `update()` and `draw()` functions. You may write other helper functions as desired.

Use this this class to draw a few emotional faces in a sketch.

A face will have three emotions. Shocked when the mouse is on the face, Happy when the mouse is within a customizable radius and then angry when the mouse is outside that radius.

The class should have the following fields:

Field | Description
-|-
`x` | face's center x location
`y` | face's center y location
`faceRadius` | radius of the face
`happyRadius` | radius of the area that makes the face happy
`emotion` | current emotion of the face
