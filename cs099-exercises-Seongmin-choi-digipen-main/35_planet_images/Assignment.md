## Requirements

- Display an image for the background
- Use images to display everything
- All image files must be self-created or license for free use for students
    - Create a ReadMe.txt file that describes how you made the image and/or where you got it from. If you got the image from somewhere, then you must also list it's license information.
- Simulation of the solar system should be based off of the Coding Math's Gravity tutorial
- Your simulation must have at least 1 sun, 3 planets, and 5 moons.
- Clicking the mouse should spawn a satellite like object that will slingshot around the sun.

## Grading Rubric

- [ ] [**core**] Created ReadMe.txt file that properly describes where the image files came from.

- [ ] Submitted a commit hash ID of when this exercise was completed.
- [ ] [**core**] Image for everything displayed
- [ ] [**core**] Image for the background
- [ ] Created physics based solar system and met the requirements described above.
