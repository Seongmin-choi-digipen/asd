# CS099 Draw Your Name Exercise

Your task is to use the 2D Shape functions to draw a picture of your name. You may draw your name in any language of your choosing, so it doesn't have to be in English.


## Requirements

### You must use each of the 2D shape functions at least one time.

- arc()
- ellipse()
- circle()
- line()
- point()
- quad()
- rect()
- square()
- triangle()

Suggestion: Use the ellipseMode() and rectMode() functions to simplify the numbers needed for drawing ellipses and rectangles.

Note: You don't have to use all of the drawing functions to represent your name. You may add decorations in order to fulfill this requirement.

### You must use rect as much as possible

The majority of the picture must be dominated with rectangles.
