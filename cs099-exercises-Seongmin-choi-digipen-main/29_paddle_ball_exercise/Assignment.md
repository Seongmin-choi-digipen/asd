# CS099 Create a Paddle and Ball Class

Create your own Paddle and Ball class using javascript ES6.

The classes should have a `constructor()`, an `update()` and `draw()` functions. You may write other helper functions as desired.

Use the ball class to get a ball the moves around the screen and bounces against the walls.

Use the Paddle class to define a simple paddle that moves left and right depending on the arrow keys.

Write a function to test if the ball and paddle collide and make the ball bounce if they do.
